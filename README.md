# circular-clustering
Current clustering schemes that work in a polar coordinate system have limitations, such as being only angle-focused or lacking generality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new analysis framework that utilizes projections onto a cylindrical coordinate system to better represent objects in a polar coordinate system.
